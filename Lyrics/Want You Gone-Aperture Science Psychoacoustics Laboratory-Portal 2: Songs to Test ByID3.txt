[00:05.27]Well here we are again
[00:07.64]It's always such a pleasure
[00:10.25]Remember when you tried
[00:11.74]To kill me twice
[00:14.56]Oh how we laughed and laughed
[00:17.26]Except I wasn't laughing
[00:19.64]Under the circumstances
[00:21.72]I've been shockingly nice
[00:25.31]You want your freedom
[00:27.42]Take it
[00:30.10]That's what I'm counting on
[00:34.62]I used to want you dead
[00:37.69]But
[00:38.27]Now I only want you gone
[00:45.94]She was a lot like you
[00:48.49]Maybe not quite as heavy
[00:50.82]Now little caroline is in here too
[00:55.54]One day they woke me up
[00:58.01]So I could live forever
[01:00.41]It's such a shame the same
[01:02.24]Will never happen to you
[01:06.06]You've got your
[01:07.02]Short sad
[01:08.22]Life left
[01:10.98]That's what I'm counting on
[01:15.27]I'll let you get right to it
[01:19.10]Now I only want you gone
[01:26.71]Goodbye my only friend
[01:29.08]Oh did you think I meant you
[01:31.65]That would be funny
[01:33.31]If it weren't so sad
[01:36.30]Well you have been replaced
[01:38.71]I don't need anyone now
[01:41.25]When I delete you maybe
[01:43.27]I'll stop feeling so bad
[01:46.84]Go make some new disaster
[01:51.68]That's what I'm counting on
[01:56.33]You're someone else's problem
[01:59.97]Now I only want you gone
[02:04.44]Now I only want you gone
[02:09.37]Now I only want you
[02:11.82]Gone
