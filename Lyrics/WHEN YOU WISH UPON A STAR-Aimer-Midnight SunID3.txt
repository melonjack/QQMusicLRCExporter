[00:04.76]詞：Ned Washington
[00:06.00]曲：Leigh Harline
[00:14.96]When you wish upon a star
[00:19.75]Make no difference who you are
[00:26.98]Anything your heart desires
[00:33.27]Will come to you
[00:39.95]If your heart is in your dream
[00:46.51]No request is too extreme
[00:52.96]When you wish upon a star
[00:59.21]As dreamers do
